This is archive of my old Discord bot. Have since then taken this bot offline. Some stuff this bot can do includes new post updates from surrenderat20.net, scraping lyrics from genius.com, ping you when your favorite webtoon (webtoons.com) is out and lot more. 

Took the bot down since working on rewriting this Discord bot from scratch. This has been functional since late 2017 and is based on very old version of discord.py (1.0.0a).

Most of features should work as intended unless some front end code changes on sites being scrapped. While old version of Reddit API is being used, recommended is switching to OAuth version.

## Requires:
* Python 3.6+
* [discordpy](https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py)
* and lot of Python modules
